	* Added additional checks in find_file_size to account for
	  older Linux systems that don't have all of the necessary
	  ioctl calls.

	* Incorporated patch from Yaakov Selkowitz to handle man page
	  copying when build dir is not the same as source dir.
	  (Sourceforge tracker #1814253)

	* Added second ioctl call in Linux version of find_file_size
	  to get the true sector size; don't just assume 512 byte
	  sectors. 

	* Changed fseek call in hash.c to fseeko for large file support
	
	* Removed spurrious -u: from getopt call in main.c

	* Removed function checks from configure.ac. We weren't using
	  them to build support, so we shouldn't waste time checking
	  for them.

	* Created new function print_error_unicode to 
	  handle errors encountered while processing
	  files with (possibly) Unicode characters in 
	  their filenames.
	
	* Added AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to configure script to 
	  account for large files on Linux. This fixes
	  the file estimation mode (-e) for Liunx. 

	* Fixed find_file_size for block devices on OS X.

	* Updated error display for Unicode filenames in dig.c
	
	* Fixed expert mode due to 64-bit values in int returns

	* Reverted back to old method of installing man pages.
	  When make install is invoked, current md5deep.1 is
	  copied over other man pages, which are all then 
	  installed normally.
