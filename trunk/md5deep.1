.TH MD5DEEP "1" "v0.15 \- January 2003" "AFOSI" "United States Air Force"

.SH NAME
md5deep \- Compute MD5 message digests

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B md5deep [\-h] [\-v] [\-V] [\-m <filename>] [\-ersbt] \fBFILES\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the MD5 message digest for any number of files while 
optionally
recursively digging through the directory structure. MD5 message
digests are computed as defined in RFC 1321. On UNIX systems,
symbolic links are ignored but mounted file systems are
traversed. Errors are reported to standard error.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Displays a progress indicator and estimate of time
remaining for each file being processed.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR <filename>
Enables matching mode. Filename should be a list of known hashes.  The
input files are examined one at a time, and only those files that match
the list of known hashes are output. This flag may be used more than once
to add more than one set of known hashes. Acceptable formats for lists of
known hashes are plain (such as those generated by md5sum or md5deep),
Hashkeeper files, iLook, and the National Software Reference Library
(NSRL) as produced by the National Institute for Standards in Technology.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Enables silent mode. All error messages are supressed.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show a help screen and exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Show the version number and exit.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Show copyright information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Ignored. Present only for compatibility with md5sum

.TP
\fB\-t\fR
