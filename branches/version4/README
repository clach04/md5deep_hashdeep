This is md5deep, a set of cross-platform tools to computer hashes, or
message digests, for any number of files while optionally recursively
digging through the directory structure.  It can also take a list of known
hashes and display the filenames of input files whose hashes either do or
do not match any of the known hashes. This version supports MD5, SHA-1,
SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool hashes. 

See the file NEWS for a list of changes between releases.

See the file COPYING for information about the licensing for this program. 

See the file INSTALL for (generic) compilation and installation
instructions. Here's the short version:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Note that you must be normally root to install to the default location.
The sudo command is helpful for doing so. You can specify an alternate
installation location using the --prefix option to the configure script.
For example, to install to /home/foo/bin, use:

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/foo

There is complete documentation on how to use the program on the 
project's homepage, http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/ 

== md5deep vs. hashdeep ==

For historical reasons, the program has different options and features
when run with the names "hashdeep" and "md5deep."

hashdeep has a feature called "audit" which:
 * Can also use a list of known hashes to audit a set of FILES. Errors
   are reported to standard error. If no FILES are specified, reads from
   standard input.

 -a Audit mode. Each input file is compared against the set of knowns. An
    audit is said to pass if each input file is matched against exactly
    one file in set of knowns. Any collisions, new files, or missing files
    will make the audit fail. Using this flag alone produces a message,
    either "Audit passed" or "Audit Failed". 

    -v - prints the number of files in each category
    -v -v = prints all discrepancies
    -v -v -v = prints the results for every file examined and every known file. 

 -k <file> - The -k option must be used to load the audit file

To perform an audit:
  hashdeep -r dir  > /tmp/auditfile            # Generate the audit file
  hashdeep -a k /tmp/auditfile -r dir          # test the audit

Notice that the audit is performed with a standard hashdeep output
file. (Internally, the audit is computed as part of the hashing process.)
