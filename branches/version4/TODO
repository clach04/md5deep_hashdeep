Because I kept ignoring this list of TODO items, I have 
moved them all to the SourceForge Feature Request Tracker.
See https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=67079&atid=516781
for all current TODO items.

Below is the retrench plan:

1 - Start with a new copy of the source
2 -  fix the autoconf files.
3 - add DFXML to the multihash program.
4 - add an output mode to the multihash program that exactly matches the output mode of the single hash md5deep, sha1deep, etc.
5 - add a mode to the multihash program that exactly matches the command-line options, and have that mode be the default when the command name changes. 
6 - migrate to C++
7 - remove your hashtable object for the STL red-black table.
