The bugs:

*** On Windows, the 32-bit version of the program cannot process known
files from the 64-bit versions of the program.

Actual output:
C:\tmp\md5deep-4.0.0_alpha_004>hashdeep64 foo.txt > known.txt

C:\tmp\md5deep-4.0.0_alpha_004>hashdeep -ak known.txt foo.txt
hashdeep: known.txt: Unable to identify file format
hashdeep: Unable to load any matching filesTry `hashdeep -h` for more
information.


Desired behavior:
C:\tmp\md5deep-4.0.0_alpha_004>c:\bin\hashdeep64.exe foo.txt >
known.txt

C:\tmp\md5deep-4.0.0_alpha_004>c:\bin\hashdeep.exe -ak known.txt
foo.txt
hashdeep.exe: WARNING: You are running a 32-bit program on a 64-bit
system.
hashdeep.exe: You probably want to use the 64-bit version of this
program.
hashdeep.exe: Audit passed



*** The audit mode is broken on all OSes

(on OS X):

$ ./hashdeep *deep > known.txt
$ ./hashdeep -ak known.txt *deep
hashdeep: Audit failed
$ ./hashdeep -vak known.txt *deep
hashdeep: Audit failed
         Files matched: 1
Files partially matched: 0
           Files moved: 5
       New files found: 0
 Known files not found: 5


Desired behavior:

$ /opt/local/bin/hashdeep *deep > known.txt
$ /opt/local/bin/hashdeep -ak known.txt *deep
hashdeep: Audit passed



*** The -vvv mode to display extreme verbosity (i.e. the status of
each file) does not work on all OSes

(On OS X, repeated commands as above, but adding the -vvv flag)
$ ./hashdeep -vvvvak known.txt *deep
hashdeep: Audit failed
         Files matched: 1
Files partially matched: 0
           Files moved: 5
       New files found: 0
 Known files not found: 5

Desired output:
$ /opt/local/bin/hashdeep -vvvvak known.txt *deep
hashdeep: User request for insane verbosity denied

*** On Win32, the audit mode does not terminate:

C:\tmp\md5deep-4.0.0_alpha_004>hashdeep64 -ak known.txt *.exe
