Version 1.3 - 25 May 04

- Windows version can process physical devices like
  \\.\PhysicalDrive0 and \\.\tape0
- Removed halting on fatal errors except "Permission Denied"
- Added error checking for cycles created by symbolic links
- Added -z flag to print file sizes
- Added -0 flag to end lines with /0 instead of newlines
- Updated documentation regarding md5deep and Cygwin
- Cleaned up Makefile, fixed support for native "make windows"


Version 1.2 - 16 Apr 04

- Added sha1deep to compute SHA-1 hashes
- Abstracted hash functions to allow other algorithms to be inserted
- Windows version now generates output with line feeds AND carriage returns
- Fixed printing of error messages for positive and negative matching together
- Cleaned up display for matching of standard input


Version 1.1 - 25 Mar 04

- Fixed processing of standard input on Windows
- Fixed cosmetic errors with time estimation to now produce a fixed length
   output and avoid spanning multiple lines


Version 1.0 - 15 Mar 04
(better late than never!)

- Moved hierarchy traversal code into separate file, dig.c
- Now able to handle symbolic links properly
- If no input files are given, uses standard input
- Added file read error handling (display an error message, pad missing data
  with zeros and continue execution).
- Added expert mode; allows user to choose which and only which types of
  files are processed
- Added -X and -M to print hashes as well as matches
- Errors in files of known hashes are now treated an non-fatal
- When estimating completion time, print the filename being processed
- Corrected NSRL import code
- Cleaned up time estimation calculation
- Fixed block device time estimation for *BSD
- Switched from unsigned long long to off_t type
- Fixed duplicate slashes in filenames from root directory (e.g. //usr/src)
- Fixed install process. Generally this meant removing flags from
  the install command.
- Added *BSD-specific includes
- Fixed minor data type issue for Gentoo linux
- Fixed typos in copyright and error messages


Version 0.16 - 7 Mar 03

Added -x flag for negative matching
Made the Makefile nicer
Added code for compatibility with FreeBSD, Solaris, and OS X.

Version 0.15 - 5 Jan 03

Added -m flag for matching support

Version 0.14 - 2 Dec 02:

Added better checks for avoiding symbolic links on *nix

Program now identifies itself correctly in Windows error messages.


Version 0.13 - 7 Nov 02:

Added -r and -e flags for recursion and time estimation, respectively.
Fixed Windows version to generate correct MD5 values. 
 (u_int_32 should have been unsigned long instead of long. Oops.)


Version 0.12 - 1 Nov 02:

First version released to "public"
Removed linux specific code
Added -b and -t flags switches for compatibility with md5sum
Cleaned up README and man page
