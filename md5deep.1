.TH MD5DEEP "1" "v1.1 \- March 2004" "AFOSI" "United States Air Force"

.SH NAME
md5deep \- Compute MD5 message digests

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B md5deep [\-v|\-V|\-h] [\-m|\-M|\-x|\-X <file>]
[\-resbt] [\-o <fbcplsd>] \fBFILES\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the MD5 message digest for any number of files while 
optionally
recursively digging through the directory structure. MD5 message
digests are computed as defined in RFC 1321. 
Errors are reported to standard error. If no FILES are specified,
reads from standard input.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Displays a progress indicator and estimate of time
remaining for each file being processed.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR <file>
Enables matching mode. The file given should be a list of known hashes.  The
input files are examined one at a time, and only those files that match
the list of known hashes are output. This flag may be used more than once
to add multiple sets of known hashes. Acceptable formats for lists of
known hashes are plain (such as those generated by md5deep or md5sum),
Hashkeeper files, iLook, and the National Software Reference Library
(NSRL) as produced by the National Institute for Standards in Technology.
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-x flag.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR <file>
Same as the \-m flag above, but does negative matching. That is, only 
those files NOT in the list of known hashes are displayed. 
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-m flag.

.TP
\fB\-M and -X\fR <file>
Same as \-m and \-x above, but displays the hash for each file that 
does (or does not) match the list of known hashes. 

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Enables silent mode. All error messages are supressed.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR <bcpflsd>
Enables expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only which) types of
files are processed. Directory processing is still controlled with the
\-r flag. The expert mode options allowed are:
.br
f \- Regular files
.br
b \- Block Devices
.br
c \- Character Devices
.br
p \- Named Pipes
.br
l \- Symbolic Links
.br
s \- Sockets
.br
d \- Solaris Doors
