MD5DEEP 
---------------------------------------------------------
Md5deep recursively computes MD5 message digests of input files.

Details on how to use md5deep are in the man page.

The MD5 algorithm is defined in RFC 1321:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 
---------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for Linux, Solaris, OS X, *BSD, and Windows are provided below.
For Windows, it's a LOT easier to just download the binary from 
http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/

Note that you will need to have root access to install md5deep in the
default location!


Linux:
--------------------------
$ make linux
# make install


Solaris
--------------------------
$ make solaris
# make install


Mac OS X  (note the different command to install!) 
--------------------------
$ make mac
# make macinstall


*BSD, and other Unicies
--------------------------
$ make unix
# make install



If you ever need to remove md5deep from your system:

# make uninstall


----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILING FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS(R)

The easiest way to get md5deep for Windows is to download the binary 
version. The current binary is available at:

http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/


If you want to compile md5deep yourself, I recommend using the (Free) 
MingGW compiler. 

First, obtain the MinGW toolkit from:  http://www.mingw.org/
Install MinGW according to the documentation and then compile:

C:\> cd md5deep-1.x
C:\> gcc -Wall -D__WIN32 -o md5deep.exe *.c -liberty


----------------------------------------------------------------------
CROSS COMPILING LINUX->WIN32

The MinGW compiler can also be used to cross-compile md5deep for Win32 
from a linux platform. (This is how the developer makes the Win32 builds!)
The MinGW FAQ has a script that downloads, configures, and installs the
MinGW compiler on a linux system:
http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-cross

Once MinGW is installed on your linux system, edit the Makefile value for
CROSSBASE with the $PREFIX you used for MinGW. Then just do:

$ make cross-win

And you should have a working md5deep.exe executable for Win32.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
CYGWIN

Compiling md5deep using the Cygwin environment is not supported.
Although it is possible to compile md5deep under Cygwin using the "make
unix" directive, this is not recommended. Not only will the resulting
executable require the cygwin1.dll file to run, but the output for each
file will be in "cygdrive" notation, which takes up extra space and may be
confusing to those not familiar with the Cygwin environment.
