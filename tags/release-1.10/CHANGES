Version 1.10 - 2 Feb 2006

- Fixed Tiger hashes being displayed in big endian instead of little endian
    Thanks to Peter Chuenkov (aka ODB) for finding this bug
- Fixed cosmetic bug in usage message

Version 1.9.3 - 5 Jan 2006

- Added Cygwin as a supported platform
- Fixed expert mode to remove a number of logical errors
    that prevented the program from correctly identifying which 
    files should be hashed. Symbolic links, in particular, were not 
    being chosen or excluded correctly.
- Added quiet mode, -q, filename is omitted from the output.
- Added Makefile directive macg5 to compile OS X G5 specific code
- Fixed comparisons between signed and unsigned variables in helpers.c
   and dig.c

Version 1.9.2 - 14 Nov 2005

- Fixed Makefile to include compiler optimizations for hashing algorithms

Version 1.9.1 - 8 Nov 2005

- Fixed bug when processing symlinks to directories introduced in
   version 1.9 by accidently removing known good code. Oops.

Version 1.9 - 7 Nov 2005

- Changed the existing return values and added ones for the matching modes 
    to indicate if any of the input files did not match a known hash and 
    if any hashes were unused. See "RETURN VALUES" section of the manpage.
- Added -n mode to display which files from the list of known hashes did
    not match any of the input files. 
- Fixed dig.c code to correctly handle links to Solaris doors.
- Fixed cosmetic bug that caused the leading slash to be omitted from the
    output under 'which matching file', or -w mode.
- Changed text displayed in matching modes for standard input. Now displays
    just "stdin" in matching mode
- Fixed bug in files.c:valid_hash that caused crash by casting
    character value into a signed integer. 
- Fixed bug in BSD hash file importing that caused crash when processing a 
    line with two parenthesis but was shorter than a valid hash. 
- Fixed cosmetic bug in hash.c:update_display to prevent the first time 
    estimate to be wildly off if it takes more than one second to read
    the first megabyte of each input file.
- Simplified hash.c by removing match_name from hash_info structure
- Minor changes to Makefile defines


Version 1.8 - 8 Aug 2005

- Added Tiger algorithm to make tigerdeep.
- Added -k mode to insert asterisks before filename, like md5sum -b
- Fixed a bug that prevented the first BSD style hash from being 
    loaded during any of the matching modes.
- Continued to simplify the Makefile. To wit:
   - Changed checks for __WIN32 to _WIN32, which is defined by the compiler.
     Removed -D__WIN32 from the Makefile.
   - Greatly reduced the number of instructions for cross compiling
   - Simplified rules for building all applications


Version 1.7 - 23 May 2005

- Added support to use BSD style hashes in matching modes
- Fixed support for Hashkeeper files that have directory information.
    Matt Kucenski helped to track this down.
- While fixing Hashkeeper support, improved support for other hash
    file formats and generalized the code in files.c
- Fixed a bug for displaying the correct matching filename in -w mode
    (ensured that extra characters are erased)
- Fixed cosmetic bug to avoid extra characters on time estimation mode
- Removed 32-bit number limitation from Win32 code, which allows 
    the display of file sizes larger than 4GB. (Note that time estimates
    for files larger than 4GB is still not available on Windows.)
- Switched printing of large numbers to C99 style (e.g. PRIu64 et al)
- Simplified the operating systems defines in the Makefile. To wit:
     - Removed -D__MACOSX for Mac. Instead check for __APPLE__, which 
       the compiler defines by default for us.
     - Removed the -D__UNIX directive. Instead just check the __WIN32
       is *not* defined whenever we put in *nix code.


Version 1.6 - 4 May 2005

- Added Whirlpool algorithm to make whirlpooldeep.
- Fixed bug to prevent trying to access 'busy' files. This happens when
    trying to access system files on Win32 that are mounted via Samba.
    Jeff Bryner helped to track this one down
- Added -w flag to display, in matching mode, which known hash matched
    the input file
- Added -b flag to remove leading directory information from filenames
- Added -a and -A flags to add a single hash to 
    positive and negative matching, respectively
- Removed -t as a valid flag, breaking compatibility with md5sum
- Enabled control of FIFO pages via expert mode on Windows
- Combined all manpages into single md5deep man page
- Added error checking to hash table functions
- Removed algorithm specific code from hash table code
- Fixed __USE_BSD define in md5deep.h to avoid compiler warnings
- Fixed minor bug to clean up Windows version of man page
- Updated install process to use $(PREFIX) for installed location
- Removed macinstall option


Version 1.5 - 31 Aug 2004

- Added SHA-256 algorithm to make sha256deep. Special thanks to
  Christophe Devine his SHA-256 implementation.
- Fixed typo in files.c for unsupport file type processing
- Fixed typo in sha1deep man page. (Had wrong reference in description.)
- Man pages are now installed mode 444 instead of 755. (i.e. non-executable)
- Cleaned up Makefile. Yes, again.


Version 1.4 - 16 Aug 2004

- Added relative paths mode
- Fixed printing of file sizes larger than 9GB for Mac, *BSD.
- Changed return values so that always returns 0 on success
    positive integer on failure (1 = user error, 2 = internal error)
- Fixed memory leak on directory open failures in dig.c
- Fixed memory leak in directory release code in cycles.c
- Fixed potential information leak in md5.c (thanks to Derek Jones) 
- Removed possible supression of critical error messages in cycles.c
- Fixed size computation for standard input
- Added support for Win32 logical drives (e.g. \\.\C:)
- Changed data structures in hash.c for ease of reading
- Added overflow counter for Win32 for files larger than 4GB

- Added error checking for cycles created by symbolic links
- Added -z flag to print file sizes
- Added -0 flag to end lines with /0 instead of newlines
- Updated documentation regarding Cygwin and Win32 compilation
- Cleaned up Makefile, fixed "make windows"


Version 1.2 - 16 Apr 2004

- Added sha1deep to compute SHA-1 hashes
- Abstracted hash functions to allow other algorithms to be inserted
- Windows version now generates output with line feeds AND carriage returns
- Fixed printing of error messages for positive and negative matching together
- Cleaned up display for matching of standard input


Version 1.1 - 25 Mar 2004

- Fixed processing of standard input on Windows
- Fixed cosmetic errors with time estimation to now produce a fixed length
   output and avoid spanning multiple lines


Version 1.0 - 15 Mar 2004
(better late than never!)

- Moved hierarchy traversal code into separate file, dig.c
- Now able to handle symbolic links properly
- If no input files are given, uses standard input
- Added file read error handling (display an error message, pad missing data
  with zeros and continue execution).
- Added expert mode; allows user to choose which and only which types of
  files are processed
- Added -X and -M to print hashes as well as matches
- Errors in files of known hashes are now treated an non-fatal
- When estimating completion time, print the filename being processed
- Corrected NSRL import code
