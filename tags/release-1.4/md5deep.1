.TH MD5DEEP "1" "v1.4 \- August 2004" "AFOSI" "United States Air Force"

.SH NAME
md5deep \- Compute MD5 message digests

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B md5deep 
[\-v|\-V|\-h] [\-m|\-M|\-x|\-X <file>] [\-zres0lbt] [\-o <fbcplsd>] \fBFILES\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the MD5 message digest for any number of files while 
optionally
recursively digging through the directory structure. MD5 message
digests are computed as defined in RFC 1321. 
Errors are reported to standard error. If no FILES are specified,
reads from standard input.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Displays a progress indicator and estimate of time
remaining for each file being processed.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR <file>
Enables matching mode. The file given should be a list of known hashes.  The
input files are examined one at a time, and only those files that match
the list of known hashes are output. This flag may be used more than once
to add multiple sets of known hashes. Acceptable formats for lists of
known hashes are plain (such as those generated by md5deep or md5sum),
Hashkeeper files, iLook, and the National Software Reference Library
(NSRL) as produced by the National Institute for Standards in Technology.
.br
\fB\fR
If standard input is used with the -m flag, displays "stdin matches"
if the input matches one of the hashes in the list of known hashes. If the
hash does not match, the program displays no output.
.br
\fB\fR
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-x flag.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR <file>
Same as the \-m flag above, but does negative matching. That is, only 
those files NOT in the list of known hashes are displayed. 
\fB\fR
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-m flag.

.TP
\fB\-M and -X\fR <file>
Same as \-m and \-x above, but displays the hash for each file that 
does (or does not) match the list of known hashes. 

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Enables silent mode. All error messages are supressed.

.TP
\fB\-z\fR
Enables file size mode. Prepends the hash with 
a ten digit representation of the size of 
each file processed.
If the file size is greater than 4GB on Windows or
9999999999 bytes (about 9.3GB) on all other operating systems, 
the program displays 9999999999 for the size.

.TP
\fB\-0\fR
Uses a NULL character (/0) to terminate each line instead of a newline.
Useful for processing filenames with strange characters.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for
each file, displays the relative file path as indicated on the command 
line.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR <bcpflsd>
Enables expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only which) types of
files are processed. Directory processing is still controlled with the
\-r flag. The expert mode options allowed are:
.br
f \- Regular files
.br
b \- Block Devices
.br
c \- Character Devices
.br
p \- Named Pipes
.br
l \- Symbolic Links
.br
s \- Sockets
.br
d \- Solaris Doors

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show a help screen and exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Show the version number and exit.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Show copyright information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR and \fB\-t\fR
Ignored. Present only for compatibility with md5sum

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns zero on a successful operation. (Successful operations can 
include permission denied, read errors, etc.) Returns one on a user
error, such as trying to do both positive and negative matching at the
same time. Returns two on an internal error. All internal errors should
be reported to the developer! See the section "Reporting Bugs" below.

.SH AUTHOR
md5deep was written by Jesse Kornblum.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
The Windows version is not able to process files with Unicode 
characters in their filenames or produce accurate time estimates 
for files larger than 4GB.

.SH REPORTING BUGS
We take all bug reports \fIvery\fR seriously. Any bug that jeopardizes the
forensic integrity of this program could have serious consequenses on 
people's lives. When submitting a bug report, please include a description
of the problem, how you found it, and your contact information.
