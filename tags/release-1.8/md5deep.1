.B md5deep
[\-m|\-M|\-x|\-X <file>]  [-a|-A <hash>]
[\-wzres0lbk] [\-o <fbcplsd>] [\fBFILES\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the hashes, or message digest, 
for any number of files while 
optionally recursively digging through the directory structure.
Can also take a list of known hashes and display the filenames
of input files whose hashes either do or do not match any of the
known hashes.
Errors are reported to standard error. If no FILES are specified,
reads from standard input.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed. Please note
that recursive mode cannot be used to examine all files of a given 
file extension. For example, calling md5deep -r *.txt will examine
all files in \fIdirectories\fR that end in .txt. 

.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Displays a progress indicator and estimate of time
remaining for each file being processed. Time estimates for files
larger than 4GB are not available on Windows.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR <file>
Enables matching mode. The file given should be a list of known hashes.  The
input files are examined one at a time, and only those files that match
the list of known hashes are output. This flag may be used more than once
to add multiple sets of known hashes. Acceptable formats for lists of
known hashes are plain (such as those generated by md5deep or md5sum),
Hashkeeper files, iLook, and the National Software Reference Library
(NSRL) as produced by the National Institute for Standards in Technology.
.br
\fB\fR
If standard input is used with the -m flag, displays "stdin matches"
if the input matches one of the hashes in the list of known hashes. If the
hash does not match, the program displays no output.
.br
\fB\fR
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-x, \-X, or \-A flags.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR <file>
Same as the \-m flag above, but does negative matching. That is, only 
those files NOT in the list of known hashes are displayed. 
\fB\fR
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-m, \-M, or \-a flags.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR and \fB-X\fR <file>
Same as \-m and \-x above, but displays the hash for each file that 
does (or does not) match the list of known hashes. 

.TP
\fB\-a\fR <hash>
Adds a single hash to the list of known hashes used for matching mode,
and if not already enabled, enables matching mode. Adding single
hashes cannot, by itself, be used to print the hashes of matching files
like the \-M flag does.
\fB\fR
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-x, \-X, or -A flags.

.TP
\fB\-A\fR <hash>
Same as \-a above, but does negative matching.
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-m flag.

.TP
\fB\-w\fR
During any of the matching modes (\-m,\-M,\-x,or \-X), displays the filename
of the known hash that matched the input file.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Enables silent mode. All error messages are supressed.

.TP
\fB\-z\fR
Enables file size mode. Prepends the hash with 
a ten digit representation of the size of 
each file processed.
If the file size is greater than
9999999999 bytes (about 9.3GB)
the program displays 9999999999 for the size.

.TP
\fB\-0\fR
Uses a NULL character (/0) to terminate each line instead of a newline.
Useful for processing filenames with strange characters.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for
each file, displays the relative file path as indicated on the command 
line. This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-b flag.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Enables bare mode. Strips any leading directory information from 
displayed filenames.
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the \-l flag.

.TP
\fB\-k\fR
Enables asterisk mode. An asterisk is inserted in lieu of a second
space between the filename and the hash, just like md5sum in 
its binary (\-b) mode.


.TP
\fB\-o\fR <bcpflsd>
Enables expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only which) types of
files are processed. Directory processing is still controlled with the
\-r flag. The expert mode options allowed are:
.br
f \- Regular files
.br
b \- Block Devices
.br
c \- Character Devices
.br
p \- Named Pipes
.br
l \- Symbolic Links
.br
s \- Sockets
.br
d \- Solaris Doors

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show a help screen and exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Show the version number and exit.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Show copyright information and exit.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns zero on a successful operation. (Successful operations can 
include permission denied, read errors, etc.) Returns one on a user
error, such as trying to do both positive and negative matching at the
same time. Returns two on an internal error. All internal errors should
be reported to the developer! See the section "Reporting Bugs" below.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
The Windows version is not able to process files with Unicode 
characters in their filenames.

Using the \-r flag cannot be used to recursively process all files 
of a given extension in a directory. This is a feature, not a bug. 
If you need to do this, use the find(1) command.

.SH REPORTING BUGS
We take all bug reports \fIvery\fR seriously. Any bug that jeopardizes the
forensic integrity of this program could have serious consequenses on 
people's lives. When submitting a bug report, please include a description
of the problem, how you found it, and your contact information.
