2008-03-04 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Working on hashdeep matching, auditing code

	* Added a file_data_t, known, to the hashdeep state variable
	

2008-03-04 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Added spaces to recorded command line in output files.
	

2008-02-22 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Moved source code from CVS to Subversion repository.
	  This shouldn't create any changes in the code, but
	  should be noted.

	* Version change to 2.1. No need for -001 anymore.
	

2007-12-27 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Fixed hashdeep current working directory and filesize display
	  when hashing standard input.

2007-12-11 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Got multihashing working. It turns out that the SHA-1
	  update code modifies the buffer that its passed.
	

2007-12-08 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Moved hash.c into the common code directory, adapting it
	  to work with both md5deep and hashdeep code. Moved display
	  code to a separate file.

	* First working version of hashdeep!
	

2007-12-08 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Updated hashing headers to only be included once.
	  Included all hashing headers in common.h

	* Modified hashing code to pass hashing context only into
	  hashing code. This requires void pointers, but avoids
	  the hashing code having to deal with the state at all.

	* Moved md5deep man pages into the md5deep directory
	

2007-12-07 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Separated md5deep and hashdeep projects into separate 
	  directories. Moved common code into include and common
	  directories. Man pages moved into man. It doesn't all
	  work just yet, but we're getting close.
	

2007-12-06 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

        * Added common.h and ui.h to Makefile.am so that they
	  are included in a distribution.

        * Copied more variables from md5deep source code to hashdeep state.

        * Updated hashdeep usage message

	* Version bump to 2.1-002

	
2007-12-05 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>
	
	* Reverting back to main.c and main.h from version 2.0.1. 
	  Starting over on code for hashdeep

	* Moved common header functions to common.h

	* Created new files ui.h and audit.h to help reuse code in hashdeep

	* Updated procedure to make README.TXT (Windows distribution 
	  readme file) in Makefile.am so that it only has one copy of the 
	  man page, not five. 

	
2007-10-31 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Added stub for hashdeep program

	* Moved state type out of main.h and into deep.h

	
2007-10-28 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Added additional checks in find_file_size to account for
	  older Linux systems that don't have all of the necessary
	  ioctl calls.

2007-10-16 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Incorporated patch from Yaakov Selkowitz to handle man page
	  copying when build dir is not the same as source dir.
	  (Sourceforge tracker #1814253)


2007-09-26 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Added second ioctl call in Linux version of find_file_size
	  to get the true sector size; don't just assume 512 byte
	  sectors. 

	* Changed fseek call in hash.c to fseeko for large file support
	
	* Removed spurrious -u: from getopt call in main.c

	* Removed function checks from configure.ac. We weren't using
	  them to build support, so we shouldn't waste time checking
	  for them.
	

2007-09-25 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Created new function print_error_unicode to 
	  handle errors encountered while processing
	  files with (possibly) Unicode characters in 
	  their filenames.
	
	* Added AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to configure script to 
	  account for large files on Linux. This fixes
	  the file estimation mode (-e) for Liunx. 

	* Fixed find_file_size for block devices on OS X.

	
2007-09-24 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Updated error display for Unicode filenames in dig.c
	
	* Fixed expert mode due to 64-bit values in int returns

	
2007-09-23 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Reverted back to old method of installing man pages.
	  When make install is invoked, current md5deep.1 is
	  copied over other man pages, which are all then 
	  installed normally.

	
2007-09-22 Jesse Kornblum <md5deep@jessekornblum.com>

	* Switched to GNU autotools
	
	* Moved list of past changes to NEWS file
