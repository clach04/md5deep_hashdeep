*** Add man pages


*** Add 'make test' directive to run compiled programs on test files 
    and insure compilation was successful. 

*** Create a new program, hashdeep, to do multi-hashing. That is, 
    compute more than one hash for each input file. For example:

$ hashdeep -a md5,sha256 foo
# hashdeep,1.0
# size,md5,sha256,filename
0,d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e,e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855,foo

Things to note in this example:
 - The program can work with arbitrary hashing algorithms
 - The file size always comes first. The file name always comes last. 
   Note that with this arrangement we shouldn't need any quotation marks
   around the filename. 

The program should be able to do matching similar to md5deep. 
For example, if the above output was saved to known.dat:

$ hashdeep -m known.dat * 
foo

$ hashdeep -wm known.dat * 
foo matches foo

This can create some unusual errors:
 - If a file matches hashes but not file size
 - If one of the hashes match but others do not
